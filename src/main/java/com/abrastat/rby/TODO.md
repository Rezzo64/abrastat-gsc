============

This outlines the differences between GSC and RBY
versions of Pokemon. As well as what needs to be done
and what has been finished.

Status: TODO

If a Pokemon is frozen, it does not thaw unless the
frozen Pokemon is hit by a Fire type attack except fire spin.

---

Status: TODO

A Pokemon hit by a trapping move (Wrap, Fire Spin, Bind,
Clamp) is incapable of moving for 2-5 turns, including
the current turn if the trapped Pokemon is slower. A
slow victim may be unable to move indefinitely, so this
is a rather significant part of strategy in RBY.

Status: TODO

The chip damage from burn is 1/16 the victim's max HP.

Status: TODO

Poison is blocked by Substitute, but sleep and
paralysis are not. Also, if I have a Substitute up and
my opponent uses Selfdestruct or Explosion, my opponent
isn't knocked out.

Moves
* trapping moves Wrap, Fire Spin, Bind, and Clamp
* Counter
* Leech seed, (Low priority) rarely used competitively
  in RBY and thankfully never used competitively on the
  same set as Toxic, because it has a wild interaction
  with Toxic in these games.
* (Hyper Beam: user does not have to recharge if
  opponent is KO'd. It's not clear to me yet that the
  program needs to incorporate this.)
* Multi strike moves ending after breaking substitute
